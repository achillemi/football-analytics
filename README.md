# Football Analytics
I use this repository to store and share my data science projects based on football data. I am not a professional in football analytics, I'm just a computer engineer who is very passionate about football and data. :grin:

## Current projects
Until now, I worked on the following projects:
### [Most Active Attacking Player](https://github.com/achillemi/football-analytics/tree/main/MostActiveAttackingPlayer) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This small script finds the *most active attacking player* for a given team throughout the World Cup of 2018. The definition of *active attacking player* is based on a metric that is further described [here](https://github.com/achillemi/football-analytics/blob/main/MostActiveAttackingPlayer/Most%20active%20attacking%20player%20in%20WC18.ipynb).
